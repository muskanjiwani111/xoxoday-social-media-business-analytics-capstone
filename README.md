## Tools & Techniques
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing  
- **R**: Descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, K-means clustering, data visualization  
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard for performance tracking and insight communication  

---

## Key Insights & Outcomes
- Tweets posted during **weekday afternoons and evenings** showed higher engagement.
- **Visual and media-based content** outperformed text-only posts.
